# Forecasts API Example Notebook

The Forecasts API delivers fast, accurate, and scalable demand forecasts—powered by the real-world events that impact your business. Whether you’re starting from scratch or augmenting an existing model, our event-driven forecasting approach improves accuracy, unlocking significant ROI and cutting development time by months.

This API provides ready-to-use, event-optimized forecasts for your business, embedding the impact of sports, concerts, school holidays, and more directly into the forecast output. There’s no need to source or model event effects separately—we handle it for you.

Why Use It?

- Event-aware by default — real-world events are built into every forecast
- Industry-specific performance — designed for demand planners, revenue managers, and ops teams
- Faster and more affordable than building your own system

PredictHQ’s Forecasts API is the only event-driven, fully automated forecasting solution available—built to get you to accurate forecasts without the complexity.
