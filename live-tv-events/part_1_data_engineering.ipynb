This guide focuses on viewership prediction for the seven top US sports leagues: NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, D1 NCAA Basketball, D1 NCAA Football, and MLS. Our TV viewership data is designed for data scientists to improve forecasting at the county and store level. This *How to Series* allows you to quickly extract the data (Part 1), explore the data (Part 2) and experiment with different aggregations (Part 3).\n",
