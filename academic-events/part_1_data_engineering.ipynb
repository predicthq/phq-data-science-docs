    "#### 1) Sub-category (sub_category)\n",

    "        -holiday\n",

This represents the full time undergraduate population that will be on holiday. The Academic Events holiday is associated with a more specific location. Its location represents the campus that students are on holiday from. Holidays in the academic events category are therefore likely to represent decremental demand in these locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Session Type (session_type)\n",
    "    This summarises whether the event is attended physically, virtually or both.\n",
    "    The three options for this field are:\n",
    "    \n",

    "The attendance numbers for these sessions are already adjusted to take account of hybrid or online sessions. The attendance figures still represent the physical attendance figures.  \n",
    "        \n",
    "#### 3) Estimated (estimated)\n",
    "Events are added when the academic calendar is released. For recurrent events, these can be estimated in advance of the official calendar release. Estimated events have an 'estimate' label applied. Estimated events can also apply to historic events where the event was added to our system but official historic calendars are not available. This field mainly applies to academic sessions and holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) On Campus (on_campus)\n",
    "        Not all events occur on campus.\n",
    "        Calculation logic.\n",
    "            - All holidays are classed as off campus\n",
