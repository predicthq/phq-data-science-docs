It not only highlights the correlation between events and your demand data but also offers a decomposition of your demand data, aiding in enhancing the precision of your demand forecasts. For a deeper dive into Beam, explore the [Beam Overview](https://www.predicthq.com/support/beam-overview).\n","\n","Our objective through this notebook is to navigate you through the following use cases facilitated by the Beam API:\n","\n","1. [Upload demand data to Beam](#part-1-upload-demand-data-to-beam): Upload your data to Beam for analysis.\n","2. [Generate Beam analysis results](#part-2-generate-beam-analysis-results): Generate Beam analysis results between events and your demand data using Beam.\n","3. [Plot and interpret Beam output](#part-3-plot-and-interpret-beam-output): Visualize and interpret the output from Beam for better insights.\n","4. [Identify relevant features using Feature Importance](#part-4-identify-relevant-features-using-feature-importance): Explore Feature Importance to identify and extract relevant features for your forecasting model.\n","5. [(Optional) Create Groups for the Analyses]( #part-5optional-create-groups-for-the-analyses): Organize your locations into groups using Beam to enhance your analysis by aggregating similar patterns.\n","\n","Utilizing Beam's decomposition and the Feature Importance feature can substantially augment the accuracy of your forecasts. If you have not been decomposing your data for forecasting purposes, Beamâ€™s functionalities provide a robust framework to dissect your data into baseline demand and remainder components, coupled with identifying critical event features essential for an accurate forecasting model. The latest feature grouping is designed to help you manage and analyze your data more efficiently by aggregating demand across multiple stores or locations. \n","For additional insights into the Beam API, please refer to our [technical documentation](https://docs.predicthq.com/api/beam)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"474c72e5b5bc498d96e29c4bd86cd2ac","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":["If using Google Colab uncomment the following code block, this is used to download a repo that contains sample data used for this notebook.

A location typically refers to the physical premise of a business like a store or a hotel. For instance, in a restaurant chain, each restaurant would represent a distinct location. See more details on how to prepare demand data [here](https://www.predicthq.com/support/uploading-your-demand-data-to-beam).\n","\n","When running Beam, you execute it over a set of locations and create a Beam analysis for each location. Then, for each location, you upload your historical demand data, such as historical retail sales data or historical hotel room booking data. This is the demand data that Beam correlates with event data. For each location, you need the latitude and longitude information. When searching for events that can impact your bussiness, we need a suitable radius for the bussiness location. Our [Suggested Radius API](https://docs.predicthq.com/resources/suggested-radius) will calculate the radius for you.\n","\n","The example code below loops over a list of input locations, creates a Beam analysis_id for each location, and uploads demand data for each location.
